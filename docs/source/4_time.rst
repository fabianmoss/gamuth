.. Sinve the relations between tones only given by 
   their location in tonal space (and the interval function)
   generalizing the notion of neighbor notes etc. corresponds
   to changing what the *lines* in Western notation mean.
   Traditionally, two lines separate tones that are a generic third apart.
   But there have been other representations. 
   For instance, the first attempts of Guido separated notes by steps.
   Let's reinterpret the lines as seconds and fifths. 
   There have also been a number of attempts to develop a fully chromatic
   notation system (Parncutt).
