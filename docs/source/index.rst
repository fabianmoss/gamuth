Learn music theory the hard way!
================================

.. warning::
    The content on these pages is very much under construction!

Welcome!

This is not a pedagogical resource for basic music theory concepts
but an in-depth introduction into the structures of Western music,
built axiomatically from tones and their relations.
The logo, a `maxima`_ (the longest note value in medieval music), 
symbolically reflects this level of difficulty.

This project is inspired by a number of great books, e.g.

* Aldwell & Schachter (2010). *Harmony and Voice Leading*.
* Cadwallader & Gagné (1998). *Analysis of Tonal Music. A Schenkerian Approach*.
* Forte (1977). *The Structure of Atonal Music*.
* Lewin (1987). *Generalized Intervals and Transformations*.
* Müller (2015). *Fundamentals of Music Processing*.
* Straus (2005). *Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory*.

What is new and unique about the approach taken here is that we take 
a computational perspective and implement all introduced concepts.
This does not only provide us with sharp and unequivocal definitions,
but also allows us to scale music theory up from the analysis of individual 
bars, sections, or pieces to that of entire repertoires and corpora!

I recently also discovered `Music for Geeks and Nerds`_ by Pedro Kroger
which looks very interesting. 
The Python project `musthe`_ also seems to pursue a similar goal.
