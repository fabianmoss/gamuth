Chapter topics include basic concepts and definitions; pitch-class sets; centricity, referential collections, and triadic post-tonality; basic twelve-tone operations; and more twelve-tone topics.Musicians and enthusiasts looking to explore advanced topics in music theory and analysis.},

It emphasizes the linear aspects of music as much as the harmonic, and introduces large-scale progressionslinear and harmonicat an early stage. The fourth edition now includes a chapter introducing species counterpoint and integrates that material into the rest of the text. A new Premium Website for students will provide interactive, guided exercises for new material covered in each unit. The Instructors Companion Site will include Guidelines for Instructors, a new instructors manual written by the authors.},
