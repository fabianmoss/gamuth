  abstract = {One curious aspect of human timing is the organization of rhythmic patterns in small integer ratios. Behavioral and neural research has shown that adjacent time intervals in rhythms tend to be perceived and reproduced as approximate fractions of small numbers (e.g. 3/2). Recent work on iterated learning and reproduction further supports this: given a randomly timed drum pattern to reproduce, participants subconsciously transform it toward small integer ratios. The mechanisms accounting for this `attractor' phenomenon are little understood, but might be explained by combining two theoretical frameworks from psychophysics. The scalar expectancy theory describes time interval perception and reproduction using Weber's law: just detectable durational differences equal a constant fraction of the reference duration. The notion of categorical perception emphasises the tendency to perceive time intervals in categories, i.e. ``short'' vs. ``long''. In this piece, we put forward the hypothesis that the integer-ratio bias in rhythm perception and production might arise from the interaction of the scalar property of timing with the categorical perception of time intervals, and that neurally it can plausibly be related to oscillatory activity. We support our integrative approach with mathematical derivations to formalise assumptions and provide testable predictions. We present equations to calculate predicted durational ratios by: (i) specifying one (of K) category of ratios, (ii) assuming a scalar timing constant, and (iii) parameterising the relationship between durational categories. Our derivations provide the basis for future computational, behavioural and neurophysiological work to test our model.},

In this paper, we study entrainment to changes in the micro-rhythmic design of the basic pulse of the groove in `Left \& Right' by D'Angelo. In part 1 of the groove the beats have one specific position; in part 2, on the other hand, the different rhythmic layers specify two simultaneous but alternative beat positions that are approximately 50-80 ms apart. We first anticipate listeners' perceptual response using the theories of entrainment and dynamic attending as points of departure. We then report on a motion capture experiment aimed at engaging listeners' motion patterns in response to the two parts of the tune. The results show that when multiple onsets are introduced in part 2, the half note becomes a significant additional level of entrainment and the temporal locations of the perceived beats are drawn towards the added onsets.},

It uses data on personal (composer-to-composer) musical influences to generate and analyze network graphs. Data on style influences and composers ‘ecological’ data are then combined to composer-to-composer musical influences to build a similarity/distance matrix, and a multidimensional scaling analysis is used to locate the relative position of composers on a map while preserving the pairwise distances. Finally, a support-vector machines algorithm is used to generate classification maps. This article falls into the realm of an experiment in music education, not musicology. The ultimate objective is to explore parts of the classical music heritage and stimulate interest in discovering composers. In an age offering either inculcation through lists of prescribed composers and compositions to explore, or music recommendation algorithms that automatically propose works to listen to next, the analysis illustrates an alternative path that might promote the active rather than passive discovery of composers and their music in a less restrictive way than inculcation through prescription.},

NES-MDB contains thousands of multi-instrumental songs composed for playback by the compositionally-constrained NES audio synthesizer. For each song, the dataset contains a musical score for four instrument voices as well as expressive attributes for the dynamics and timbre of each voice. Unlike datasets comprised of General MIDI files, NES-MDB includes all of the information needed to render exact acoustic performances of the original compositions. Alongside the dataset, we provide a tool that renders generated compositions as NES-style audio by emulating the device's audio processor. Additionally, we establish baselines for the tasks of composition, which consists of learning the semantics of composing for the NES synthesizer, and performance, which involves finding a mapping between a composition and realistic expressive attributes.},

Especially the tunings of gamelan ensembles have fascinated researchers since the early stages of the disciplines of Systematic and Comparative Musicology, as these tunings are considerably different from Western, Middle Eastern or other music traditions and even differ between gamelan ensembles. Additionally most instruments of the ensemble are percussion instruments with inharmonic overtone spectra. One way to explain certain characteristics of gamelan tunings is by relating the inharmonic sound spectra of the percussion instruments to the perception of dissonance. This theory is assuming that the psychoacoustic sensation described as auditory roughness is perceived as dissonant and is therefore avoided. This study investigates the influence of musical roughness on the perception of different gamelan tunings by correlating psychoacoustic measurements with a perception test in an online survey. Based on sound samples of an existing gamelan ensemble set based in Hamburg, Germany, a gamelan tune was built in a DAW. By detuning the sounds, several versions of the tune in different temperaments were built. It appears that the measured roughness perception and roughness measurements of the different tunes correlate very well for all detuned cases. Still the original piece does not correlate, pointing to a different perception strategy for the original ensemble tuning.},

  abstract = {This dissertation addresses the question of how musical pitches generate a tonal center. Being able to characterize the relationships that generate a tonal center is crucial to the computer analysis and the generating of western tonal music. It also can inform issues of compositional styles, structural boundaries, and performance decisions. The proposed Spiral Array model offers a parsimonious description of the inter-relations among tonal elements, and suggests new ways to re-conceptualize and reorganize musical information. The Spiral Array generates representations for pitches, intervals, chords and keys within a single spatial framework, allowing comparisons among elements from different hierarchical levels. Structurally, this spatial representation is a helical realization of the harmonic network (tonnetz). The basic idea behind the Spiral Array is the representation of higher level tonal elements as composites of their lower level parts. The Spiral Array assigns greatest prominence to perfect fifth and major /minor third interval relations, placing elements related by these intervals in proximity to each other. As a result, distances between tonal entities as represented spatially in the model correspond to perceived distances among sounding entities. The parameter values that affect proximity relations are prescribed based on a few perceived relations among pitches, intervals, chords and keys. This process of interfacing between the model and actual perception creates the opportunity to research some basic, but till now unanswered questions about the relationships that generate tonality. A generative model, the Spiral Array case; provides a framework on which to design viable and efficient algorithms for problems in music cognition. I demonstrate its versatility by applying the model to three different problems: I develop an algorithm to determine the key of musical passages that, on average, performs better than existing ones when applied to the 24 fugue subjects in Book I of Bach's WTC; I propose the first computationally viable method for determining modulations (the change of key); and, I design a basic algorithm for finding the roots of chords, comparing its results to those of algorithms by other researchers. All three algorithms were implemented in Matlab.},

  abstract = {Many structural aspects of music, such as tonality, can be expressed using hierarchical representations. In music analysis, so-called keyscapes can be used to map a key estimate (e.g., C major, F minor) to each subsection of a piece of music, thus providing an intuitive visual representation of its tonality, in particular of the hierarchical organization of local and global keys. However, that approach is limited in that the mapping relies on assumptions that are specific to common-practice tonality, such as the existence of 24 major and minor keys. This limitation can be circumvented by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the tonal space. The DFT does not rely on style-specific theoretical assumptions but only presupposes an encoding of the music as pitch classes in 12-tone equal temperament. We introduce wavescapes, a novel visualization method for tonal hierarchies that combines the visual representation of keyscapes with music analysis based on the DFT. Since wavescapes produce visual analyses deterministically, a number of potential subjective biases are removed. By concentrating on one or more Fourier coefficients, the role of the analyst is thus focused on the interpretation and contextualization of the results. We illustrate the usefulness of this method for computational music theory by analyzing eight compositions from different historical epochs and composers (Josquin, Bach, Liszt, Chopin, Scriabin, Webern, Coltrane, Ligeti) in terms of the phase and magnitude of several Fourier coefficients. We also provide a Python library that allows such visualizations to be easily generated for any piece of music for which a symbolic score or audio recording is available.},

From the viewpoint of traditional music theory, it offers many innovations in notation as well as in the substance of rhythmic and reductional theory.},

Our model is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a statistical approach for discovering hidden topics in large corpora of text. In our adaptation of LDA, symbolic music files play the role of text documents, groups of musical notes play the role of words, and musical keyprofiles play the role of topics. The topics are discovered as significant, recurring distributions over twelve neutral pitch-classes. Though discovered automatically, these distributions closely resemble the traditional key-profiles used to indicate the stability and importance of neutral pitchclasses in the major and minor keys of western music. Unlike earlier approaches based on human judgement, our model learns key-profiles in an unsupervised manner, inferring them automatically from a large musical corpus that contains no key annotations. We show how these learned key-profiles can be used to determine the key of a musical piece and track its harmonic modulations. We also show how the models inferences can be used to compare musical pieces based on their harmonic structure.},
