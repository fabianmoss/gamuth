Learn music theory the hard way!
================================

This is not a pedagogical resource for basic music theory concepts
but an in-depth introduction into the structures of Western music,
built axiomatically from tones and their relations.

This project has been inspired by 

    * Lewin (2007). *Generalized Intervals and Transformations*.
      Oxford: Oxford University Press.

This is an ongoing work, hence no guarantee for completeness or accuracy yet.
