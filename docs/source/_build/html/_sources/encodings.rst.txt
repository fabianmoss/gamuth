Video
~~~~~

Normally, video is not taken into account when talking about music encodings.
But the visual aspect is very important, in particular when the music involves forms of 
bodily expression such as dance or celebrations at a festival, as well as light shows.
In certain music genres, especially since the late 20th century, music and video 
are inseparable.  (also research on Motion Capture :cite:`Danielsen2015_MovingBeatStudying`).
