Notes
~~~~~

(Tones + Duration)
blablabla...

Sinve the relations between tones only given by
their location in tonal space (and the interval function)
generalizing the notion of neighbor notes etc. corresponds
to changing what the *lines* in Western notation mean.
Traditionally, two lines separate tones that are a generic third apart.
But there have been other representations.
For instance, the first attempts of Guido separated notes by steps.
Let's reinterpret the lines as seconds and fifths.
There have also been a number of attempts to develop a fully chromatic
notation system (e.g. Parncutt).


Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Musical time vs. performance time

The simple two-dimensional model (sound vs. time)
from the beginning of the book already seems quite inadequate
at this point where we have engaged with many different aspects of the
sound and pitch side of music. But also in the time domain we will
see that the reality is more complex than this simple picture conveys.
