<h2><span class="section-number">10.1. </span>Modeling tonal pitch-class coevolution<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-tonal-pitch-class-coevolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The change/evolution of each pitch class <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=i-a\)</span> is given by the
changes in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{X}_i=(X^{1}_i,\dots,X^{t}_i,\dots,X^{T}_i)^\top\in \mathbb{R}^{T}\)</span>.
The pitch-class coevolution matrix is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbf\Sigma=\left(\mathrm{corr}(\mathbf{X}_i, \mathbf{X}_j)\right)_{ij}\in[-1,1]^{n\times n}\]</div>
<p>and reflects the similarity of the diachronic change of pitch-classes.</p>
<p>These upper subplot in Figure [fig:evolution_tpcs] have shown the
changes in the usage of each pitch-class over time. The coloring and
ordering suggests indeed a coevolution but recall that the ordering was
put in manually. The question is whether we can learn something about
the structure from the data by analyzing the coevolution of the tpcs
which is operationalized as the pairwise correlation (the Pearson
correlation coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span>) (maybe use sample coefficient
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>?) of two pc-evolution vectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
\rho_{p,q} = \frac{\mathrm{cov}(p,q)}{\sigma_p\sigma_q},\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{cov}(p,q)\)</span> is the covariance and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>
the standard deviation. Figure [fig:coevolution_tpcs] shows the
pairwise tonal pitch class coevolution values across the entire
timeline.</p>
<p>Interesting observations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Three regimes are clearly separated: flats (upper left), diatonics
(center), and sharps (lower right)</p></li>
<li><p>The chromatic regimes are of roughly the same size, (only visible in
overall plot; the sharps are slightly larger), i.e. the heatmap has
two orthogonal symmetry axes</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the chromatic notes (flats and sharps) are weakly
positively correlated</p></li>
<li><p>F<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\flat\)</span> (and more extreme flats) does not occur in the
entire corpus</p></li>
<li><p>The weakest correlations are highly interesting as well: The weakest
correlation is with the chromatic lower neighbor and the tritone
(e.g. A vs. A<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span>, E<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span>; E vs
E<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span>, B<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span>; B vs. B<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span>, F;
F<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sharp\)</span> vs. F, C) This is only true for “central” tpcs
(white keys diatonic)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can use this correlation matrix to plot distances between the pitch
classes. Restricting the relations to the center of the plot, the
diatonic notes plus F<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sharp\)</span> and B<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span> these
distances actually approximate the line of fifths!</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">10.2. </span>Deciphering pitch-class coevolution<a class="headerlink" href="#deciphering-pitch-class-coevolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The last section presented how strong the evolution of pitch classes
correlates with each other. The heatmap in Figure
[fig:coevolution_tpcs] indicated an interesting connection to the
ordering of tpcs on the line of fifths. But this ordering was achieved
manually, based on theoretical knowledge. How strong is this connection
based on the available data?</p>
<p>One way to investigate this is to reduce the high-dimensional space to a
smaller one. A common method to achieve this is <strong>principal component
analysis</strong> (PCA). PCA analyzes the variance in the data and projects the
data to a lower-dimensional space while maximizing the retained
variance.</p>
<p>Subsequently, one can inspect the individual principal components
individually and interpret the variance within and between them.</p>
<p>The results are very interesting:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Roughly, 64% of the variance is explained with the diatonic-chromatic
distinction (PC1)</p></li>
<li><p>About 22% is explained by the sharp-flat distinction (PC2). Note also
that C is on the zero-line for PC2 (does this really mean
something?).</p></li>
<li><p>Another 6% of variance is explained by the third principal component.
It roughly corresponds to the numbers of accidentals and follows,
approximately, a zig-zag pattern for the 5 regions
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\flat\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\flat\)</span>, ”, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sharp\)</span>, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sharp\sharp\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>PC4 is not easy to interpret, but it still captures a difference
between, flat, diatonic, and sharp tpcs. Indeed, it seems that this
component captures enharmonic equivalence! The tpcs C, G, D, A, was
well as their enharmonic sharp and flat equivalents are all separated
from the other notes. The same goes for F and E# (but not Gbb).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems that the PCA reduction was not only able to capture meaningful
dimensions, but also a meaningful relation between them, namely the
hierarchical one depicted in Figure [fig:pca_hierarchy].</p>
<p>The variance explained by each of the components can be interpreted as
the weight or importance of these dimensions for the data. The two most
important principal components are PC1 and PC2, together contributing
approximately 86% of variance to the data. Figure [fig:PCA_2dim] shows
how these two dimensions interact. Largely speaking, diatonic and
chromatic tpcs can be separated by a vertical line (not exactly),
whereas sharpward and flatward tpcs can be separated by a horizontal
line, with C, the only tpc that is neither flatwards nor sharpwards,
being exactly on the axis. Moreover, the three respectively most extreme
tpcs, Fbb–Gbb and Ax–Bx, are located close to the origin of the PCA
transformed plot. This means that they do not contribute much to the
variance in the data. These are also precisely the ones outside of the
enharmonic equivalence shown in PC4.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">10.3. </span>TPC coevolution per historical period<a class="headerlink" href="#tpc-coevolution-per-historical-period" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This “global view” can be broken down to compare how the tpc
correlations change over time. The next figure shows the correlations
for 50-year periods</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>1500-1550: Two clusters emerge</p></li>
<li><p>1550-1600: Clear separation between recta and ficta.</p></li>
<li><p>1600-1650: Dahlhaus situates the origin of harmonic tonality in the
early 17th century (Untersuchungen, p. 14), namely (following Fétis)
in Monteverdi’s Cruda Amarilli SV 94, mm. 9-19, 24-30. Without
diminishing Monteverdi’s influence we can see here that the first
half of the 17 century was indeed a time of change, at least with
respect to the conjunct usage of tones. But note also that the most
prominent composer in that epoch in the dataset is Gesualdo who is
well-known for his unusual harmonies.</p></li>
<li><p>1650-1700: Confusion</p></li>
<li><p>1650-1800 The separation between flat, diatonic, and sharp tpcs
stabilizes. This is the closest to the overall picture above
(although not as centered). The closest distribution to the overall
distribution (check!) is the one in the late 18th century. It
coincides with the common-practice period. Since we see that tpc
behavior is different before and after, the CPT should not be taken
as a synonym to tonal music. This affects large portions of empirical
research of tonality presupposing two modes with clear and stable
patterns. Review also Harasim et al. (2019)</p></li>
<li><p>1800-1900: Strong correlation between all accidentals vanishes. The
diagonal line is very clear. In this time, all pitch classes exhibit
the greatest independence historically speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>1900-…: Looks like a mix of CPT and Extended</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dahlhaus situates the origin of harmonic tonality in the early 17th
century (Untersuchungen, p. 14), namely (following Fétis) in
Monteverdi’s *Cruda Amarilli* SV 94, mm. 9-19, 24-30. Without
diminishing Monteverdi’s influence we can see here that the first half
of the 17 century was indeed a time of change, at least with respect to
the conjunct usage of tones. But note also that the most prominent
composer in that epoch in the dataset is Gesualdo who is well-known for
his unusual harmonies.</p>
<p>Turn argument around: Use inter-pc correlations to show importance of
fifth structure! What about thirds?</p>
