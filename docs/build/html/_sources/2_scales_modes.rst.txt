Scales and Modes
================

A vast majority of musical cultures globally have some notion or
concept of organization systems for discrete tones
:cite:p:`Brown2013_UniversalsWorldMusics`. Those can be called *scales*
or *modes*. While this general description holds, the musical reality is
incredibly diverse and seems to defy uniform analytical approaches
:cite:p:`Mehr2019_UniversalityDiversityHuman`.

In this chapter, we are going to learn some tonal characteristics
and organization systems from a range of musical cultures from
different continents. While this will already hint at the global variation,
it is by no means exhaustive. Nor are the descriptions below meant to entirely
represent those cultures. Many factors, especially contextual sociopolitical
ones, are out of the scope of this book, and we restrict the descriptions to
what we can model using the approch established in the earlier chapter:
a formal description of tonal relations.

The diatonic scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Music in the Western tradition fundamentally builds on
so-called *diatonic* scales, an arrangement of seven tones
that are named with latin letters from A to G. "Diatonic" can
be roughly translated into "through all tones". Within this scale,
no tone is privileged, so the diatonic scale can be appropriately
represented by a circle with seven points on it. Mathemacally,
this structure is equivalent to :math:`\mathbb{Z}_7`.

[tikz figure here]

Now, if we want to determine the relative relations between the tones,
it is necessary to assign a reference tone that is commonly called the *tonic*,
or *finalis* in older music.

For example, if the tone D is the tonic, we can determine
all other scale degrees as distance to this tone.
Scale degrees are commonly notated with arabic numbers with a caret:

.. math::
   \text{D}: \hat{1}\\
   \text{E}: \hat{2}\\
   \text{F}: \hat{3}\\
   \text{G}: \hat{4}\\
   \text{A}: \hat{5}\\
   \text{B}: \hat{6}\\
   \text{C}: \hat{7}\\

Taking these seven notes in scalar order,
they can be converted to their *fifth order* via

.. math::
   \phi: t \mapsto 4t \mod 7

because the octave is divided into 7 steps and there
and a fifths consists of 4 steps.
Under this view the diatonic scale is a subsegment
of the *line of fifths*
:cite:p:`Temperley2000_LineFifths,Mossaccepted_LineFifthsCoevolution`

.. exercise::
   :label: ex:tonnetz

   How does the fifth order relate to the Euler Space / Tonnetz mentioned earlier?

Before we move on to another important musical dimension,
time, we have to consider
one of the most famous musical scale systems
(at least among music academics): Balinese Pelog and Slendro.
