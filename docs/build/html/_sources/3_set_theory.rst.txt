Pitch-Class Set Theory
======================

Content adapted from :cite:t:`Straus2005,Forte1977`. 
In this chapter, "pitch class" always entails octave *and* enharmonic equicalenve.

Pitch classes
-------------

Octave equivalence
..................

Octave equivalence maps all pitch classes with the same label/name to one class, 
e.g. all C's on the piano get mapped to pitch class C, all Ab's get mapped to pitch class Ab, 
and all G#'s get mapped to G#. 

Octave equivalence has perceptual correlates (cite paper) and is frequently employed in composition.
For instance, the double bass sounds an octave lower as a cello but they are notated identically,
or a fugue subject enters in different registers. 
The octave is the most fundamental interval with a frequency ratio of 2:1.
Octave equivalence transforms the Euler space to the Tonnetz :math:`\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}`.

Enharmonic equivalence
......................

Enharmonic equivalence describes the identification of pitches like F#4 and G#4.
Enharmonic equivalence transforms the Euler Space to a tube, namely :math:`\mathbb{Z}_{12} \times \mathbb{Z}` 
(the chromatic circle and the octave line).

[diagram]

Taking octave equivalence and enharmonic equivalence together, 
we arrive at the torus that contains all twelve enharmonic (and octave-related) pitch classes,
and which can be represented by numbers :math:`k\in \mathbb{Z}_{12}`

[diagram]

Both equivalences are indepentend of one another, i.e. we have the following commuting diagram between tonal spaces:

[diagram]

Assuming enharmonic equivalence has a number of implications:

- we cannot distinguish between diatonic and chromatic semitones 
- we cannot distinguish between augmented fourths and diminished fifths
- we cannot distinguish between dominant seventh chords and augmented sixth chords 
- and more

.. note::
    Describe relation to equal temperament.

For the remainder of this chapter, pitch classes designate entities for which both equivalences are assumed.
It is thus appropriate to represent them on a circle. Since each pitch class can have infinitely many spellings,
going the reverse direction is a difficult inference problem, for which a number of algorithms have been proposed
(see advanced chapter on :ref:`Pitch spelling`).

Intervals
---------

Generally, intervals describe the distance between two points (see Chapter :ref:`Intervals`).
But depending on which representation for tones we chose (or, equivalently, which equivalences we assume)
the types of the intervals changes as well.

.. note::
    Add paragraph about what types are. 

Pitch Intervals
............... 

Pitch intervals describe the distance between two pitches in semitones. That is, we do assume enharmonic equivalence 
but not octave equivalence. Consequently, we can visualize pitch intervals in
