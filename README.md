# musictheory - thoughts about an introduction for programmers
General remark: Create excercises with listening, composing and analyzing tasks.

- Sounds in the external world
- Perception, constraints (e.g. audible range)
- discretization
  - Musical Universals (3-7 note scales)
  - allows symbolic representation
- scales (independent from tuning/temperament): collections of pitches
- members of scale: notes
  - neighborness
  - Schenkerian terms: neighbor notes
  - pitch classes
  - pitch class sets
- intervals
  - counterpoint
    - consonance / dissonance
  - interval classes
  - interval class vectors
 
- special pitch class sets: chords
  - Triads
    - Euler space
    - tonnetz
  - seventh chords

- notes in time: durations, rhythm
  - Schenkerian terms: passing notes
  - cognitive framework: meter
  - metrical hierarchies
  
- visualisations (pitch-time plots)
  - pianoroll
  - MIDI
  - modern Western notation
  - different keys (not only treble and bass)
