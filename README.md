# musictheory - thoughts about an introduction for programmers
General remark: Create excercises with listening, composing and analyzing tasks.

- Sound in the external world
- Perception, constraints (e.g. audible range)
- discretization
-- Musical Universals (3-7 note scales)
-- allows symbolic representation
- scales (independent from tuning/temperament)
-- members of scale: notes
-- neighborness
-- Schenkerian terms: neighbor notes, 
- notes in time: durations, rhythm
-- Schenkerian terms: passing notes

- visualisations (pitch-time plots)
-- pianoroll
-- MIDI
-- modern Western notation
-- different keys (not only treble and bass)
