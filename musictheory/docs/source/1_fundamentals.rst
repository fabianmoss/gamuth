Fundamentals
============

Tonal spaces
------------

The theory presented in here can be described as a *tonal theory* in the sense 
that its most fundamental objects are *tones*, discrete musical entities that have
a certain location in tonal space. 
A tonal space is then a metrical space describing all possible tone locations,
and the metric is given by an *interval function* between the tones. Note that by this definition,
there are as many different tonal spaces as there are interval functions.

While many aspects and examples will be taken 
from Western (classical) music, the theory is in principle not restricted to this 
tradition but extends well to virtually all musical cultures where a tone is a meaningful concept.

Tones
~~~~~

Let's start with a mental exercise: imagine a tone.
Contemplate for a while what this means.
Does this tone have a pitch? A duration? A velocity (volume)?
