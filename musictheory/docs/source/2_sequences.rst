Modeling musical sequences
==========================

Schenkerian theory
------------------

describe central Schenkerian concepts in terms 
of tones, intervals, and underlying tonal spaces.
E.g., a neighbor note is the next note (upper or lower)
in a tonal space that has a notion of neighborhood, e.g.
the diatonic or chromatic spaces. But in this generalized sense,
a neighbor can be a semitone, a whole tone, a third, or a fifth
apart. What the neighbor actually is, depends on the underlying 
assumed tonal space. Accordingly, the *Bassbrechung* is an upper 
neighbor on the circle or line of fifths, while the common neighbor note
only exists in diatonic spaces.
