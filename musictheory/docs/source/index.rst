Learn music theory the hard way!
================================

Welcome!
--------

This is not a pedagogical resource for basic music theory concepts
but an in-depth introduction into the structures of Western music,
built axiomatically from tones and their relations.
The logo, a `hemidemisemiquaver`_ (or a sixty-fourth note), 
symbolically reflects this level of difficulty. A PDF version of the contents
of this page can be found :download:`here <_static/musictheory.pdf>`.

This project is inspired by these a number of books, e.g.

* Aldwell & Schachter (2010). *Harmony and Voice Leading*.
* Cadwallader & Gagné (1998). *Analysis of Tonal Music. A Schenkerian Approach*.
* Forte (1977). *The Structure of Atonal Music*.
* Lewin (1987). *Generalized Intervals and Transformations*.
* Müller (2015). *Fundamentals of Music Processing*.
* Straus (2005). *Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory*.

I recently also discovered `Music for Geeks and Nerds`_ by Pedro Kroger
which looks very interesting. 
The Python project `musthe`_ also seems to pursue a similar goal.
