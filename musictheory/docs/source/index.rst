Learn music theory the hard way!
================================

Welcome! 

This is not a pedagogical resource for basic music theory concepts
but an in-depth introduction into the structures of Western music,
built axiomatically from tones and their relations.
The logo, a `hemidemisemiquaver`_ (or a sixty-fourth note), 
symbolically reflects this level of difficulty. A PDF version of the contents
of this page can be found :download:`here <_static/musictheory.pdf>`.

This project has been inspired by this great book:

* Lewin, D. (2007). *Generalized Intervals and Transformations*.
  Oxford: Oxford University Press.

I recently also discovered `Music for Geeks and Nerds`_ by Pedro Kroger
which looks very interesting.
