Fundamentals
============

Tonal spaces
------------

The theory presented in here can be described as a *tonal theory* in the sense 
that its most fundamental objects are *tones*, discrete musical entities that have
a certain location in tonal space. 
A tonal space is then a metrical space describing all possible tone locations,
and the metric is given by an *interval function* between the tones. Note that by this definition,
there are as many different tonal spaces as there are interval functions.

While many aspects and examples will be taken 
from Western (classical) music, the theory is in principle not restricted to this 
tradition but extends well to virtually all musical cultures where a tone is a meaningful concept.

Tones
~~~~~

Let's start with a mental exercise: imagine a tone.
Contemplate for a while what this means.
Does this tone have a pitch? A duration? A velocity (volume)?

Schenkerian theory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

describe central Schenkerian concepts in terms 
of tones, intervals, and underlying tonal spaces.
E.g., a neighbor note is the next note (upper or lower)
in a tonal space that has a notion of neighborhood, e.g.
the diatonic or chromatic spaces. But in this generalized sense,
a neighbor can be a semitone, a whole tone, a third, or a fifth
apart. What the neighbor actually is, depends on the underlying 
assumed tonal space. Accordingly, the *Bassbrechung* is an upper 
neighbor on the circle or line of fifths, while the common neighbor note
only exists in diatonic spaces.
